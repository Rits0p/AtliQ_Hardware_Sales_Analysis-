# üßæ AtliQ Hardware Sales Dashboard | Power BI + SQL Project

An advanced business intelligence project built using **Power BI**, **Power Query**, and **SQL**, this interactive dashboard presents actionable insights into AtliQ Hardware‚Äôs sales performance, revenue trends, and profit contributions across multiple Indian markets and product segments.

---

## üìå Project Overview

The aim of this project was to analyze and visualize AtliQ Hardware's sales data to derive strategic insights. The dashboard is divided into three main sections:

- **Key Analysis**: Overview of revenue and sales quantities across markets  
- **Profit Analysis**: Deep dive into profit margins, contribution %, and underperforming zones  
- **Performance Analysis**: Time-based revenue and profit tracking with product-level breakdowns  

All data was first cleaned and structured using **Power BI Power Query**, and then validated with **SQL queries** to ensure accuracy, perform joins, and check data integrity before building the model.

## üí° My Journey & Experience

Initially, the raw dataset contained inconsistencies and missing values. Using **Power Query**, I performed data cleaning operations like:

- Removing nulls and duplicates  
- Formatting data types  
- Creating relationships for dimensional modeling  

Once cleaned, I used **SQL** to:

- Validate joins between sales, market, and product data  
- Verify totals, revenue logic, and profit calculations  
- Run test aggregations to cross-check against Power BI outputs  

Designing the dashboard was a creative process ‚Äî I built everything from scratch, using no templates. Each visual, filter, and slicer is custom-created for maximum usability and business clarity.
